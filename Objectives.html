          In the new age of social media, many solutions have been created for socializing and advertising. These new solutions came with new issues and unmet expectations that are yet to be addressed. One of the biggest is providing feedback and
          knowledge to users on their photos. Whether in reference to finding the best picture for a dating app profile, or the best group picture to show off a vacation, many people find themselves stuck, with no option but to ask friends what’s
          best. Pictured solves this. With a revolutionary system for feedback to determine what picture out of a selected few is, “best”. Advertisers have been more or less doing the same type of ad systems on social media for the past 10 years,
          always trying to get the users to interact with the ad in a meaningful way. Pictured addresses this issue with a new, better, and more effective advertising interaction system.

          Have you ever created a social media account, and you were not sure what picture to use as your profile picture? Have your friends ever argued over who is more attractive, or what animal is more cute, or what color is better for a given
          context? Wouldn't it be nice for companies to be able to know what ads look better compared to others? What models are preferred? And so on? Out of the dozens of photos of yourself that you might have, which one is the best? It's hard to
          know, isn't it? This is what Pictured solves.
        </p>

      <h1 class="title-obj">The Solution</h1>

          Pictured allows anyone to get immediate feedback from real people on their photographs. Businesses, instagram users, tinder users, everyone benefits. This way consumers and distributers can be confident that they are using the best image
          for the task at hand. No speculation needed. Businesses can advertise on the platform while figuring out their optimal ads for other platforms. Online daters can find out what photos make them look best. No one will ever have a hard time
          choosing a profile picture again, and wholesalers can know with comfort that they chose the right stock image. The possibilities are endless. This is the start of something new and massive, it changes everything and it complements every
          existing social media platform.
